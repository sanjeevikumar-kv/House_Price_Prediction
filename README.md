# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using various features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and other attributes. The model is designed to estimate the price of a house based on these inputs. This project was completed during my CodeClause internship as an AI intern, which lasted for 1 month.

## Features
- **Area**: The area of the house in square feet.
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms.
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms.
- **Stories**: Number of stories.
- **Mainroad**: Whether the house is located on the main road.
- **Guestroom**: Whether the house has a guestroom.
- **Basement**: Whether the house has a basement.
- **Hotwaterheating**: Whether the house has hot water heating.
- **Airconditioning**: Whether the house has air conditioning.
- **Parking**: Number of parking spaces.
- **Prefarea**: Whether the house is located in a preferred area.
- **Furnishingstatus**: Furnishing status of the house.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

## Steps
1. **Importing Data:**
   - Data is loaded from a CSV file containing various features related to houses.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizations are created to understand the relationships between features and the target variable (price).
   - Correlation matrix is analyzed to identify how different features correlate with house prices.

3. **Model Building:**
   - The dataset is split into training and test sets.
   - Preprocessing includes encoding categorical features and scaling numerical features.
   - A Random Forest Regressor model is used to predict house prices.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error.

## Usage
1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the notebook and execute each cell to run the analysis and model training.

## Contribution
This project was completed as part of my internship at CodeClause. It involved data analysis, model building, and evaluation. Special thanks to the CodeClause team for their guidance and support during this project.
